## About Add Modulo
---
__Add Modulo__ is a game that teaches player about basic Addition, [Modulo operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) and Strategy Thinking. This game itself is based on [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia) Local Children's game called "Tambah Tambahan" and also a variant of the [Chopstick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_(hand_game)) Game. In Indonesia, this game is indeed famous, but only among certain ages. All Indonesians born around 2000 know this game, but the rest who weren't born around 2000 tend not to know this game. 

By Making this game I wanted to educate children around the world, and also preserve this local game to the world.
